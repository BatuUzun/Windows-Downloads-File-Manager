# Windows Downloads File Manager

This is my Python script that allows you to manage your downloads folder. Because I hate typing Downloads in Windows searchbar, I decided to code this Python script.
This script changes current directory of files in the Downloads folder and moves them under the Desktop directory.
This script also detects the language of operating system and determines the path of Downloads and Desktop directories.
User may choose moving files to the Desktop directory either seperately or inside a folder.
If the destination folder is already exists, user may overwrite it (According to user's decision).
PyQt6 is used to generate a GUI.
