# Windows Downloads File Manager

This is my Python script that allows you to manage your Downloads folder. Because I hate typing 'Downloads' in the Windows search bar, I decided to code this Python script. This script changes the current directory of files in the Downloads folder and moves them under the Desktop directory. The script also detects the language of the operating system and determines the paths of the Downloads and Desktop directories. The user may choose to move files to the Desktop directory either separately or inside a folder. If the destination folder already exists, the user may overwrite it (according to the user's decision). PyQt6 is used to generate a GUI. In order to see my project running, you can check my GoogleDrive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uK4mMWNqXnR9XINzyN5Q3m4kwvUyurbp?usp=drive_link
